Computing solutions to intractable planning problems is particularly problematic in dynamic, real-time domains.  For example, visitation planning problems, such as a delivery truck that must deliver packages to various locations, can be mapped to a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  The TSP is an NP-complete problem, requiring planners to use heuristics to find solutions to any significantly large problem instance, and can require a significant amount of time.  Planners that solve the dynamic variant, the Dynamic Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP), calculate an efficient route to visit a set of potentially changing locations \citep{psaraftis88dynamic}.  When a new location becomes known, DTSP planners typically use heuristics to add the new locations to the previously computed route.  Depending on the placement and quantity of these new locations, the efficiency of this adapted, approximated solution can vary significantly \citep{psaraftis95dynamic,laporte00classical,larsen2000dvrp}.  Solving a DTSP in real time thus requires choosing between a TSP planner, which produces a relatively good but slowly generated solution, and a DTSP planner, which produces a less optimal solution relatively quickly.

Instead of quickly generating approximate solutions or slowly generating better solutions at runtime, this dissertation introduces an alternate approach of precomputing a library of high-quality solutions \textit{prior} to runtime.  One could imagine a library containing a high-quality solution for every potential problem instance consisting of potential new locations, but this approach obviously does not scale with increasing problem complexity.  Because complex domains preclude creating a comprehensive library, I instead choose a subset of all possible plans to include. Strategic plan selection will ensure that the library contains appropriate plans for future scenarios.

Experimental results demonstrate that plan quality comparable to online repair can be achieved by calculating solutions for a sample of the potential problem instances.  I present novel algorithms that accept the solution sample and then approximate solutions to other problem instances by exploiting structure in the solution space.  For domains with solution spaces that do not contain sufficient structure, I show that applying abstraction, normalization, and reindexing operations to the solutions can create the necessary structure.  For the domains tested, the algorithms generated full plan libraries containing solutions as good or better than online repair by calculating solutions to as few as 0.2\% of the potential problem instances.

This dissertation thus contributes (1) a representation framework to reason about the structure of solution spaces, (2) novel algorithms to exploit structure in the solution space in order to generate plan libraries, (3) techniques to transform the structure of the solution space to facilitate the use of the algorithms, and (4) an evaluation of the algorithms in several test domains.


%Properly indexed, problem instances with the same solutions tend to be clustered in homogeneous regions within the problem space. The algorithms presented in this dissertation attempt to discover these regions by sampling the problem space, and estimate the overall structure of the space. 
%There are a large number of new problem instances, but generally a much smaller number of unique plans
%Thus the strategy is to identify the clusters
