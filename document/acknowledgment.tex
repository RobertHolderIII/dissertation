I would like to thank Dr.~Tim Finin and Dr.~Marie desJardins for their help and patience in helping me complete this process on a part-time basis since 2004.  Appreciation is also extended to my committee, Dr.~Tim Oates, Dr.~Scott Cost, and Dr.~Donald Miner for their feedback and flexibility.

I also would like to thank the PROMISE program, directed by Dr.~Renetta Tull, for the amazing amount of support supplied over the course of completing this degree.

Thanks also are extended to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for its support of my continuing education.  Many individuals from the Lab were very supportive in this endeavor.  Rose Daley introduced me to this problem area as part of a DARPA project.  Dr.~I-Jeng Chang, Dr.~Scott Cost, John Piorkowski, Dr.~Ralph Semmel, Dr.~David Silberberg, Dr.~Paul McNamee, and David Watson were some of many individuals who guided me in various ways.

Various fellow graduate students were also instrumental in accomplishing this goal.  In particular, I would like to mention Dr.~Blazej Bulka, Dr.~Eric Eaton, Dr.~James MacGlashan, Dr.~Patti Ord\'{o}\~{n}ez Rozo, and Dr.~Donald Miner.
