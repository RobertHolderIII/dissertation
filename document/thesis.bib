	which capture different behaviours exhibited by universal plans.
	We show that universal plans which run in polynomial time and are
	of polynomial size cannot satisfy even the weakest type of completeness
	unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. However, by relaxing either
	the polynomial time or the polynomial space requirement, the construction
	of universal plans satisfying the strongest type of completeness
	becomes trivial.},

	by finding a least-cost path from start to goal. As a byproduct of
	having an optimal path they also determine the optimal solution cost.
	In this paper we focus on the problem of determining the optimal
	solution cost for a state-space search problem directly, i.e. without
	actually finding a solution path of that cost. We present an efficient
	algorithm, BiSS, based on ideas of bidirectional search and stratified
	sampling that produces accurate estimates of the optimal solution
	cost. Our method is guaranteed to return the optimal solution cost
	in the limit as the sample size goes to infinity.We show empirically
	that our method makes accurate predictions in several domains. In
	addition, we show that our method scales to state spaces much larger
	than can be solved optimally. In particular, we estimate the average
	solution cost for the 6x6, 7x7, and 8x8 Sliding-Tile Puzzle and provide
	indirect evidence that these estimates are accurate.},

  abstract = {Case-based reasoning (CBR) systems solve problems by retrieving and
	adapting the solutions to similar problems that have been stored
	previously as a case base of individual problem solving episodes
	or cases. The maintenance problem refers to the problem of how to
	optimize the performance of a CBR system during its operational lifetime.
	It can have a significant impact on all the knowledge sources associated
	with a system (the case base, the similarity knowledge, the adaptation
	knowledge, etc.), and over time, any one, or more, of these knowledge
	sources may need to be adapted to better fit the current problem-solving
	environment. For example, many maintenance solutions focus on the
	maintenance of case knowledge by adding, deleting, or editing cases.
	This has lead to a renewed interest in the issue of case competence,
	since many maintenance solutions must ensure that system competence
	is not adversely affected by the maintenance process. In fact, we
	argue that ultimately any generic maintenance solution must explicitly
	incorporate competence factors into its maintenance policies. For
	this reason, in our work we have focused on developing explanatory
	and predictive models of case competence that can provide a sound
	foundation for future maintenance solutions. In this article we provide
	a comprehensive survey of this research, and we show how these models
	have been used to develop a number of innovative and successful maintenance
	solutions to a variety of different maintenance problems.},

	a reasonable way of determining how much coverage (competence) in
	the problem space that a particular case offers?
